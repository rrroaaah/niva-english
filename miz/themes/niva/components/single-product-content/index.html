                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title line-height-4" id="description-link">Undoubtedly, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is one of the flagship smartphones available on the market that has the ability to provide very good and wonderful performance in various sectors. At first glance, you will completely realize that you are facing a powerful and flagship smartphone. An attractive and even different design that has given a special visual appeal to this smartphone. On the front view, you see a uniform and very beautiful screen equipped with the Infinity-O notch design. The circular notch cut-out at the top and left corner of the screen houses the selfie camera sensor. The curvature of the screen on the side parts has also caused the bezel to reach the minimum possible amount, and ultimately, the screen occupies 91.4% of the front view. The fingerprint sensor, as a very widely used security feature, is also located under the screen, and according to the tests performed, you should know that this optical sensor has the ability to provide very fast performance in unlocking the screen.

                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">The iPhone 13 family of smartphones was introduced in the form of four phones: iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13, and iPhone 13 mini. Undoubtedly, the two Pro and Pro Max models, as the company's flagships, benefit from more powerful technical specifications. But meanwhile, the iPhone 13 along with the mini model have been released to the market with a more affordable price so that the possibility of purchase is possible for more users. In this article, we will see what specifications the iPhone 13 carries compared to the previous generation and what performance it displays in different sectors. Perhaps given the almost similar specifications of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 12, the question may arise for you as to why the iPhone 13 can have better performance. So stay with us to find out the reasons for the better and more powerful performance of the iPhone 13 compared to the iPhone 12.</p>
                <h3 class="txt-big-title text-color font-weight-black">Attractive Design</h3>
                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">Apple is not very keen on changing its successful designs and prefers to maintain its successful and attractive design language. The iPhone 13 also benefits from a similar design to its previous generation. In the front view, we see the same familiar notch and cutout of the previous series, which this time has a smaller width compared to the iPhone 12 screen notch. On the back view, we also see the placement of two camera sensors which, unlike the iPhone 12 model, this time the two camera sensors are placed in a diagonal arrangement with an LED flash in a square-shaped cutout. This is while the two camera sensors on the back of the iPhone 12 are placed next to each other in a columnar arrangement.</p>
                <img src="../assets/media/images/component/c1-1.jpg" alt="" class="w-100">
                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">In this section as well, it must be said that the iPhone 13 benefits from a screen similar to the iPhone 12. A 6.1-inch screen with a resolution of 1170 x 2532 pixels of the OLED type with Super Retina XDR technology is considered for this powerful smartphone. The pixel density of 460ppi per inch has made this screen capable of providing very high image quality. The Scratch-resistant ceramic glass screen protector can also well protect the screen of this smartphone against possible impacts and drops.
                    <br>As we know, the screens of the two models iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max have the ability to provide the first 120 Hz refresh rate. This is the first time in the history of Apple smartphones that we are witnessing such a screen. But the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, like the flagships of previous generations, have the ability to provide a 60 Hz refresh rate. In terms of brightness, this screen has the ability to provide a maximum brightness of 1200 nits (candelas per square meter). Utilizing such a level of brightness has caused us to witness very high and high-quality image clarity from the iPhone 13 screen in diverse lighting conditions and even direct sunlight.

                <h3 class="txt-big-title text-color font-weight-black">Camera</h3>
                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">Perhaps at first glance and on paper, the camera sensors considered for the iPhone 13 do not differ much from the iPhone 12 camera sensors, but undoubtedly the iPhone 13 can have better performance in this section compared to the iPhone 12 model. You might ask yourself why? We will tell you further. First, we will take a look at the specifications of the camera sensors considered for this smartphone. A main camera sensor with a resolution of 12 megapixels, f/1.6 aperture, 26 mm focal length of the wide type along with a camera sensor of the ultra-wide type with a resolution of 12 megapixels, f/2.4 aperture, 120-degree viewing angle, and 13 mm focal length constitute the dual camera sensors of the iPhone 13. For the selfie camera as well, a 12-megapixel wide-type sensor with f/2.2 aperture is considered, which also has the ability to record 4K quality video at a rate of 60 frames per second. But why can the iPhone 13, by utilizing camera sensors similar to the iPhone 12, provide higher quality image outputs? The main reason for this event is the more powerful processor considered for the iPhone 13.</p>

                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">This is the complete Xiaomi flagship in Iran <br>It supports the Persian language in an excellent, coordinated, and professional manner<br>I want to get this phone, what adapter should I get that would be good
                    <br>In the specifications, it says wireless charger support; does it also charge with a car wireless charger?<br>Global ROM is installed on it, supports Persian language and Google Play.
                </p>

                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">One of the main reasons for better image output is the Image Signal Processor or ISP, which is one part of the processor. So naturally, utilizing a more powerful processor provides higher quality image outputs. The performance of the 12-megapixel main camera sensor in daylight leaves no room for debate. Very attractive dynamic range, excellent details, and very attractive contrast are well seen in the recorded output images. The aperture opening also has very good light absorption, and this indicates the excellent performance of this smartphone in recording night or low-light images. The ultra-wide camera sensor also, with a wider viewing angle compared to the main camera sensor, makes it possible for you to record images with a wide and very attractive viewing angle (for example, nature photography and group photos).</p>

                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title">But Apple's flagships have always had much to say in the field of video recording, and still none of the company's Android competitors have been able to have better performance compared to Apple's flagships in the field of filming. The main camera sensor of this smartphone has the ability to record video with a maximum quality of 4K and a rate of 60 frames per second. This camera sensor is equipped with the very attractive OIS feature or Optical Image Stabilization. A feature that well removes unwanted vibrations during video recording and ultimately provides you with a very high-quality video output. Like the previous generation, the camera sensor of this phone also has the ability to record Cinematic video, which is the highest possible quality of video recording among all the flagships in the world. But this time, Apple has considered significant improvements for the filming section of this smartphone to easily meet the needs of a professional videographer as well. The very amazing autofocus of this camera, thanks to artificial intelligence or AI, has displayed unique performance. Autofocus between people's faces (for example, two people are present in the camera frame and the focus is on the face of the person further forward, as soon as the first person turns their head and looks at the next person, the camera automatically focuses on the second person) is one of the new and very attractive features of this powerful smartphone.</p>
                <h3 class=" txt-big-title text-color font-weight-black">Unrivaled Processor and More Powerful Battery</h3>
                <p class="text-color font-weight-bold txt-mid-title ">We must accept that to this day, the powerful processors of Apple smartphones alongside the unique iOS operating system have been able to display very amazing performance. This time too, the iPhone 13, like its older brothers, namely the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, is equipped with the company's most powerful processor, the A15 Bionic. A processor with 5-nanometer architecture and consisting of 6 cores (2 more powerful cores along with 4 cores with normal performance and less energy consumption). For the GPU or graphics processor, a dedicated 4-core processor is considered. <br>According to benchmark results and tests performed, we must say that there is no game in the world that the iPhone 13, by utilizing such a powerful processor, would not have the ability to run. Of course, it is worth mentioning that this phone will have the ability to run heavy games such as Call of Duty Mobile and Asphalt 9 at the highest graphical settings. On the other hand, the 5-nanometer architecture of this processor has also caused it to have lower energy consumption compared to processors with 7 and 10-nanometer architecture, and ultimately provide a longer useful lifespan per 100% charge.
                    <br> The iPhone 13 has been released to the market in three models with internal memories of 128, 256, and 512 GB. Compared to the iPhone 12, as we see, there is no longer any news of the 64 GB internal memory and instead, the iPhone 13 is equipped with 512 GB internal memory (the iPhone 12 was not equipped with 512 GB internal memory). In the battery capacity section, just like every year, Apple has not said anything about the amount of battery capacity considered for this smartphone. But according to Apple, the iPhone 13 has the ability to provide a better useful lifespan per 100% charge compared to the iPhone 12. The presence of a processor with 5-nanometer architecture and the newer technology of this processor compared to the A14 Bionic processor will have significantly less energy consumption.
