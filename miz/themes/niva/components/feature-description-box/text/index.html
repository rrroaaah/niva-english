        <p class="description ellipsis-4">The iPhone 13 CH mobile phone is the new flagship from Apple, launched with several new features and a dual camera. The iPhone 13 display is equipped with a Super Retina panel to provide users with very pleasing images. This display has a very high resolution; so much so that in its 6.1-inch size, it packs about 460 pixels per inch. This phone supports wireless battery charging. Face recognition using the front camera is another feature used in the new Apple iPhone. In terms of hardware, this phone benefits from the new A15 chip, which has 15 billion transistors and has excellent thermal control to be able to support new virtual reality features that Apple is heavily focused on these days, in addition to regular tasks. According to Apple itself, this phone is 50 times faster than version 12. The processor has a new modular design that has significantly lowered battery consumption, giving you higher battery retention. Your display quality on the iPhone 13 is 120Hz, and you will witness high quality. Apple has placed a graphics processor in this series of iPhones that is 30% faster than the iPhone 12 series, promising that you can run games with heavier and larger graphics and MAPs. One of the features we see in the iPhone 13 is its cinematic ProRes video recording system, which could start a revolution in mobile phone video recording. Non-active phones become active by inserting internal SIM cards, and unlike active models, the product seal has not been broken. Active phones from the Apple brand are also such that due to restrictions on some Apple products for Iran, they are officially activated and sealed in neighboring countries by inserting a SIM card once, and you should know that this process does not cause any problems regarding the product warranty. European, Japanese, and UAE part numbers are single-SIM, and UAE part numbers do not support FaceTime. The JA part number (Japan) also does not mute the camera shutter sound even in silent mode.</p>
